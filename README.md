## Description

This project is a backend API developed using Node.js and Express.js, utilizing a MySQL database for data storage. It features routes for handling CRUD operations on resources such as products and categories, with Sequelize likely used for ORM functionality. The API employs middleware functions for tasks like parsing requests and error handling, and testing is conducted using Insomnia to verify the functionality of endpoints by sending HTTP requests and examining responses. Overall, the project provides a robust backend infrastructure for managing data in an e-commerce or similar application.
